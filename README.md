# GitHub Tabizer

Why? Because I'm tired of manually appending `?ts=2` to the URL when viewing .go files on GitHub.

## Installation

### From Chrome Web Store

TODO

### From source

1. Clone the repository:
```
$ git clone git://github.com/nysa/github-tabizer
```
2. Navigate to `chrome://extensions/` and enable "Developer mode".
3. Click on "Load unpacked extension..."
4. Open the directory `/src` from the project root.

## Roadmap

- Configurable tab size (currently only 2)
- Configurable file types (currently only .go)
